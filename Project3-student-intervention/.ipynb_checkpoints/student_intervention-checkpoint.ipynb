In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

Note, that we may still output numerical values, indicating the probability of membership of each category for a sample, but the fact that we are classifying into categories makes this a classification rather than a regression problem."

    "As you can see, there are several non-numeric columns that need to be converted! Many of them are simply `yes`/`no`, e.g. `internet`. These can be reasonably converted into `1`/`0` (binary) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other columns, like `Mjob` and `Fjob`, have more than two values, and are known as _categorical variables_. The recommended way to handle such a column is to create as many columns as possible values (e.g. `Fjob_teacher`, `Fjob_other`, `Fjob_services`, etc.), and assign a `1` to one of them and `0` to all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "These generated columns are sometimes called _dummy variables_, and we will use the [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) function to perform this transformation. Run the code cell below to perform the preprocessing routine discussed in this section."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "3 models that are appropriate for the problem are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Gaussian Naive Bayes.\n",
    "  - uses: spam detection, and document classification. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering)\n",
    "  - strengths are:\n",
    "    - that it is extremely fast\n",
    "    - handles large numbers of features well.\n",
    "    - doesn't require a lot of training data\n",
    "  - weaknesses:\n",
    "    - doesn't model relationships/correlations between the features, so if this is a significant feature of the data then performance may in principle suffer. Rarely an issue in practice though. (\"Optimality of Naive Bayes\", by H. Zhang elaborates on why this is.)\n",
    "    - since probability used in the classification is constructed from the product of the probabilities based on each of the individual features, then missing or bad/noisy data for one feature could affect the whole classification.\n",
    "  - suitable for this problem, since we have relatively small amounts of seemingly low-noise training data, with lots of features.\n",
    "        \n",
    "2) Ensemble methods, e.g. Adaboost with Decision Tree learners.\n",
    "- uses: Pedestrian detection from images: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning)#cite_note-14\n",
    "- strengths:\n",
    "  - resistant to overfitting, provided that underlying weak learners are relatively weak and not themselves prone to overfitting; also provided that the data is relatively noise free.\n",
    "- weaknesses:\n",
    "  - will overfit to very noisy or misclassified data.\n",
    "- suitable here, since data seems to be relatively low noise. Individual feature decision tree stubs would make suitable weak learners.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3) Logistic Regression\n",
    "- uses:\n",
    "  - widely used in medical and social sciences and engineering and economics. One example is the prediction of mortality rates of injured patients in the \"Trauma and Injury Severity Score\". (see:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression#cite_note-5)\n",
    "  - strengths: a fast, a conceptually simple yet effective classifier.\n",
    "  - weaknesses: less powerful than some other classifiers, in terms of the complexity of the decision boundary that it can support (which is effectively a linear separator).\n",
    "  - suitable here: given that we require a fact clasifier to reduce computational costs, and have a large number of dimensions so the limitations of a linear decision surface are likely to be less significant.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Intuition on the whole list (for my own notes - please feel free to comment on any incorrect intuitions here.)*\n",
    "- Gaussian Naive Bayes. - good. fast.\n",
    "- Decision trees ~ no. Have a tendency to overfit. we have a lot of dimensions, and would need a deep tree to utilise them, making us very suspeptible to overfitting.\n",
    "- Ensemble methods - yes. the smoothing across learners reduces the likelyhood of overfitting, whilst still allowing many dimensions to be considered, as part of the classification decision. e.g. AdaBoost, or RandomForests.\n",
    "- KNN - No - too many dimensions. not enough data to provide good coverage, and all attributes considered equally\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent. Simple and effective approach. Can also handle many features. Would also be worth consideration. \n",
    "- Support Vector Machines - powerful technique. handles many dimensions well. limitations: doesn't scale well to big datasets since it is computationally expensive.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression - would be also be suitable. Simple and often effective type of classifier. Potentially less powerful at separating the classes than some of the other methods however.\n"

Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction.

    "The chosen model (a Logistic Regression classifier) works by trying to calculate a probability that a student will pass, by looking at the properties of the data in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is constructed in a way that it can calculate an output score lying between 0 and 1, by considering all of the features of a student record (except the pass/fail column itself).  The score can be considered as the probability that the student passes, so scores over 50% are classified as a predicted pass, and below 50% classified as requiring intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, the model holds a number of \"weights\", which are a set of numbers, on which it bases it's calculation, by combining them with the data in the student record. The model is \"trained\" by setting its weights using an algorithm which adjusts them to give the least error when classifying all the records in the training data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained in this way, the model with these \"learned\" weights can be used to classify new student records and hence \"predict\" which students are likely to pass and which may benefit from intervention.\n"
